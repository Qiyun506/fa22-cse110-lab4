1. it will print `values add: 20`
2. it will print `final result: 20` 
3. it will print `values add: 20`
4. it has error, becauses the let define the variable result only within the range fo the `if(add)`     block. Therefore, when the line 13 called result, it will find result is not defined.
5.  it has error, because the result is a `const` variable, it cannot be changed by using assignment operator.
6.  it has error, because the program has error as what described in line 5 and it does not reach line 13.
